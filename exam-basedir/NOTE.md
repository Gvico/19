# NOTE

This folder contains the programs i successfully did for exams, as well as their subjects.

PLEASE NOTE that there's a high possibility for the programs contained here to be AWFULLY written, but hey, they work.
I will probably try to optimize them in a (i hope) not-so-distant future, and they will be less eye-hurting.
